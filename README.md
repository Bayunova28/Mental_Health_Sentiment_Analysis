<p align="justify">Mental health problems affect society as a whole, and not just a small, isolated segment. They are therefore a major challenge to global development. No group is immune to mental disorders,
but the risk is higher among the poor, homeless, the unemployed, persons with low education, victims of violence, migrants and refugees, indigenous populations, children and adolescents, abused women 
and the neglected elderly.</p>

<p align="justify">BERT, short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a Machine Learning (ML) model for natural language processing. It was developed in 2018 by researchers at Google AI Language and 
  serves as a swiss army knife solution to 11+ of the most common language tasks, such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.</p>
